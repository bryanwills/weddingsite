         <h3>GENERAL QUESTIONS</h3>

          <br/>
        <ul>
          <li>Where is Santa Marta?</li> 
          Santa Marta is located in the northeast region of Colombia and its surrounded by the Caribbean sea
          <li>How to get to Santa Marta?</li>
          Our suggestion is to travel from your city/country of origin to Bogota, capital city of Colombia. Once there, you can fly round trip to Santa Marta through one of the local airlines. Santa Marta is less than a 90-minute flight from Bogota.
            Take into consideration that depending on your arrival time to Bogota, you may need to spend the night there and travel to Santa Marta the next day (or whenever you wish to, if you would like to spend some time in Bogota prior to December 28).
            Our most recommended airline is Avianca (www.avianca.com), but all other local airlines are highly recommended as well. A website such as www.despegar.com provides you with all options available.
            Please note that every year, the week of December 24th-January 1st is always the busiest, most popular week in Santa Marta. Therefore, availability and prices reflect its popularity.
            An estimate.
          <li>How much does it cost?</li>
          You can fly Bogota-Santa Marta round trip anywhere between $90-$200/person roundtrip, depending of airline, luggage, and how far in advance flights are booked 
          <li>What’s the weather like?</li>
          It’s HOT. Specially if you’re joining us from Canada. Pack as lightly and tropical as possible. Take into consideration that Bogota’s temperatures are colder, therefore having a jacket or light layer is recommended.
          <li>What is Colombian currency?</li>
          Colombia uses Colombian pesos. We suggest a website such as www.oanda.com/currencyconverter to understand pricing better
          <li>Is it safe?</li>
          Maria was born and raised in Colombia, and she spent 6 years of her life in Santa Marta. Short answer “YES, it is safe”. However, we do recommend you inquire with the bride and/or locals as to what areas to avoid, if needed.
            We strongly recommend the use of apps such as Uber for safer transportation, and/or make use of taxis that you have ordered
            <li>  What is there to do in Santa Marta?</li>
            Santa Marta is a beautiful town. It has beautiful beaches, museums, restaurants, bars, and the world famous Tayrona Park, which we strongly recommend exploring if you are hoping to stay a few days in Santa Marta.
            (Feel free to ask the bride for any information regarding Santa Marta and exciting things to do while visiting)
            <li> Are there any other places to visit?</li>
            While in Colombia, we recommend visiting Medellin, Cali, Bogota, and Bucaramanga. All these cities have various things to offer, and you will not be disappointed.  
            (For further or more specific information, let us know and we will be more than happy to guide you)
